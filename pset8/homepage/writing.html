            "Time after time, life succeeds in exceeding your expectations. It won’t stop. That craving inside your mind to know what’s going to happen after this, even if you’re in the best of times or in the worst. You challenge your own mind and memory by believing that you’re the best version of yourself. That you’ve learnt everything there was for you to learn. That you’re ready for whatever life throws at you. But when life actually throws, you lose all idea and memory of what the feeling of being in control actually means. You are back in Square One!<br>

<br>With your homework done, you get ready for some nice dinner that you had to fight with your mum over, because she wanted you to have broccoli, while you fancied some fries. You go back to your room and play a little with your toys until you fall asleep on the floor, but you don’t care. You’re far too high in spirit to actually bother.<br>

<br>You wake up to a stressful night, where the last of your cares are dinner plans. You have an important test tomorrow and you cannot fail. All your mental energy is focused on one simple task: success. In your test preparation, you discover that you have a strong memory, a tendency to work hard, and a little bit of self confidence and control. Life is giving you cotton candy, and you just can’t say no. It’s a blink of an eye that separates your heaven of a life from an armageddon!<br>

<br>You cannot see clearly from the sting of tears. Everything is a mess. You’re in over your head, everything stinks, and you’re the only one in the world who is in distress. Life is so unfair that you have to muster enough strength to conquer the whole world. Failure is new to you. For the first time, no cotton candy for you today. Better luck next time—dear life. Your memory tricks you but you believe it. You believe that this is just a phase and that you can pull through. With enough support from others and self propelling, you manage to get to a safe haven of calmness. Life is simple when you have just beat it. You won. Whatever problems life threw at you, you just made lemonade. It feels so much better to be the reason of your own happiness, that you forget how blissful you were with fries instead of broccoli.<br>

<br>A while later, what seemed to you as hell suddenly appears as a trial of it. You remember the problems of yesterday and see the problems of today and curse your memory for remembering everything from the color of your first crush’s eyes to the exact incidents of your heartbreak of a failure, but can’t remember how you used to conquer life. You were the king of the world with your fries and games, but now here you are a shadow of who you were. Life has tricked you again. Life just threw another one at you and you failed again. You know that you’ll feel better eventually. You know that your success will come one day and everyone will be staring at you, star struck by your achievements. They will look at this moment of doubt with laughter and amazement.<br>

<br>But, it’s a moment. It’s just one moment in a vastness of other moments in your life which throws at you problems and cotton candy randomly. You have a brain which convinced you of self control and memory and skill, just to swarm you with doubts and failures at the first sight of a bad moment. Eventually, your idea of success will diminish to nothing. What you used to be ecstatic about will start to feel commonplace. The frenzy of success you felt was merely fries and toys. You’re nothing in this world of greats. The media makes sure you see individuals, all around this world you used to be king of, doing things no one thought possible. Why? Just so they get your attention. Just so you believe you need them. Just so you set your goal to be one of those people who appear on media to make other people feel inferior and sad they exist. At this point, your memory again will fail to remind you that what you wanted in the beginning was just some fries and a blissful evening.<br>

<br>This is the reality of what we call our world today. An entire population of human beings with no apparent goal, with no apparent purpose, and with no apparent destination. You were the king of the world literally, I’m telling you because I know. I gave you the seat to govern the whole world with one condition; to never leave your chair and never become a normal person. Yet, you were just so curious about how all those people thought. What can possibly be the reason behind all their strange actions?? Now you know! Now you know that the kid who didn’t care about fries in his belly or toys on the floor is the same man who got smashed with life fireballs, knowing through every second that he is the only one eating broccoli in a world of fries, knowing that he is not what he thought he was, knowing that he now forgot that he used to be.... the king of the world."<br>
